===================================================================
This repository contains scripts, modules and pipelines that were
used in the analysis of "Title of paper here".

Pipelines
==========

Pipelines have a large number of dependencies. Pipelines are generally
just a wrapper for scripts and functions that are defined elsewhere
in the repository (modules and scripts directories). As such, it is 
possible to run through the analysis one step at a time by using scripts 
that are present in the scripts/ directory and functions that are available
either in modules/ or R/.
