Functional profiles
====================

Metagenomic data analysis often seeks to answer questions regarding the functional
capabilities of the community. This can be achieved in two ways. Firstly, and most
conveniently (though not neccessarily most accurately) this can be done through alignment
of raw reads to functional annotations. The pipeline attempts to carry out this analysis
by using RPS-BLAST to align reads to a database of conserved protein domains (NCBI CDD). These
are then annotated with their associated Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) identifier and
functional categories represented by the reads are counted.
