Alignment and counting
===============================

We are picking up the analysis at the point at which raw fastq files have
been filtered for contaminating adapters, pairs have been flashed and reads
mapping to rRNA and mouse have been removed. Details of these steps are in the 
paper. 


Alignment
==========

The first step in the analysis is to assign reads to taxa and functional groups.
In order to do this we need some databases. We have used the NCBI non-redundant
protein database (`nr`_) for taxanomic purposes and the integrated gene catalogue
(`IGC`_) for assessing functions.

.. _nr: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/FASTA/nr.gz

.. _IGC: ftp://climb.genomics.cn/pub/10.5524/100001_101000/100064/1.GeneCatalogs/IGC.pep.gz


We used DIAMOND to align sequences to the reference databases so first we built
database indexes::

    diamond makedb --db nr --in nr --threads 16

and::

    diamond makedb --db igc --in IGC.pep --threads 16



NOTE: DIAMOND takes uncompressed files as input


Next we ran the alignment for each fastq file (reads) to each database 
(fastq files need to be converted to fasta format first e.g. using `fastx toolkit`_). As 
an example:

conversion::

    fastq-to-fasta stool-HhaIL10R-R1.fastq.gz > stool-HhaIL10R-R1.fasta 

alignment::

    diamond blastx --db nr --query stool-HhaIL10R-R1.fasta -o stool-HhaIL10R-R1.diamond.tsv


This was done for each sample (DNA-seq and RNA-seq) against each data base resulting in

16x DNA-seq to nr
16x RNA-seq to nr
16x DNA-seq to IGC
16x RNA-seq to IGC


Counting
=========

Our main objective was to identify community structure and functional changes between mice
with and without colitis. In order to do that we first needed to count the number of
reads that mapped to each genus and each functional category. This is where the analysis
of taxonomy and function diverge. 


For taxnomic profiling We used the lowest common ancestor approach (LCA) to 
assign reads to genera implemented using lcamapper.sh from mtools (see dependencies). This 
requires the mapping file of gi number to taxonomy id that is distributed with mtools::

    lcamapper.sh -i stool-HhaIL10R-R1.diamond.tsv -f Detect -ms 50 -me 0.01 -tp 50 -gt gi_taxid_prot.bin -o stool-HhaIL10R-R1.lca

Again each file that was aligned to the ncbi nr database is used as input to lcamapper.sh. To obtain counts per
genus we use the lca2table.py script that is in the scripts/ directory of this repository::

    cat stool-HhaIL10R-R1.lca | python scripts/lca2table.py --summarise=taxa-counts --log=stool-HhaIL10R-R1.counts.tsv.log > stool-HhaIL10R-R1.counts.tsv
