Defining colitis-dependent NOGs
================================

We can run the overlap analyses and PCA for NOGs as we did for genera (DNA) in the previous sections. We won't therefore
go over the same functions. 

Out metagenomeSeq analysis was performed on NOGs and we identified 1221 and 669 NOGs to be differentially abundant in 
metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data sets, respectively. The overlap between these sets suggested that there were 
some NOGs that were transcriptionally activated in colitis, leadingus to hypothesise that these were due to responses
by bacteria to an alteration in the gut niche.

A few tasks were performed before we produced Fig. 2f - some of which did not end up in the manuscript. For example we
built the RNA fold / DNA fold ratio for NOGs using the metagenomeSeq differential abundance files::

    >> import PipelineMetaomics
    >> PipelineMetaomics.buildRNADNARatio("DNA/gene_counts.diff.tsv",
                                          "DNA/gene_counts.diff.tsv",
                                          "rna_dna_ratio.tsv") 

Then we built a list of NOGs that were common between the DNA and RNA data sets from the databases that contain
tables of differential expression results. First load the tables::

    >> import CGAT.Pipeline as P
    >> P.load("DNA/genus_diamond_aggregated_counts_diff", "DNA/genus_diamond_aggregated_counts_diff.load")
    >> P.load("RNA/genus_diamond_aggregated_counts_diff", "DNA/genus_diamond_aggregated_counts_diff.load")


then::

    >> PipelineMetaomics.buildCommonGeneList("RNA/csvdb",
                                             "DNA/csvdb",
                                             "common_genes.tsv")


then we build the differentially abundant NOGs list from database (Hh + aIL10R vs. Steady state)::

    >> PipelineMetaomics.buildGeneDiffList("RNA/csvdb",
                                           "common_genes.tsv",
                                           "RNA/diff_genes.tsv")

    >> PipelineMetaomics.buildGeneDiffList("DNA/csvdb",
                                           "common_genes.tsv",
                                           "DNA/diff_genes.tsv")

and just before plotting we annotate NOGs with their differential abundance status i.e
in DNA, RNA or both data sets::

    >> PipelineMetaomics.annotateRNADNARatio("rna_dna_ratio.tsv",
                                             "DNA/diff_genes.tsv",
                                             "RNA/diff_genes.tsv",
                                             "rna_dna_ratio.annotated.tsv")


and we plot the DNA and RNA fold chagnes, fit a linear model and plot the 95% predition intervals. There is 
a little bit of sneakyness here as before we created the final plot we found NOGs of interest. This function
picks up a file called goi.tsv that contains annotations for the plot. These annotations are for NOGs that
are annotated as being involved in oxidative stress resistance and are up-regulated in metatranscriptomic
data and defined as colitis-responsive (lying outside of the 95% prediction interval for the model fit)::

    >> PipelineMetaomics.PlotSets("rna_dna_ratio.annotated.tsv",
                                  "rna_dna_ratio.annotated.png")

And that is Fig. 2 done!
