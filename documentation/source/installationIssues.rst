Installation issues

If you have any issues installing the CGAT repositories then contact nicholas.ilott@kennedy.ox.ac.uk.

I ran into some problems trying to install `bx-python`_ in a virtual environment (dependency for
PipelineMetaomics.py). A work-around is to install bx-python in system site-packages and link to the virtualenv site-packages.
