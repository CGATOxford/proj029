Quick analysis
================

Once the dependencies have been installed, the quickest and easiest way to run the analysis is to simply
type::


    $ python <path_to_proj029>/scripts/run_analysis.py 
             --cgatdir=<path_to_cgat>
             --proj029dir=<path_to_proj029>
             --rdir=<path_to_R_install>
             --datadir=<path_to_data>


This will run through all the analyses in the subsequent pages (except for the computationally intensive ones). It
would be advisable to read through the rest of the documentation however to learn which files relate to which
steps.
